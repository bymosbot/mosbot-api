# API Responses

- Success responses use `{ data: ... }`.
- List endpoints include pagination `{ data: [], pagination: { limit, offset, total } }`.
- Error responses use `{ error: { message, status } }`.
- Common status codes:
  - `201` for created records
  - `204` for successful deletes with no body
  - `400` for validation failures
  - `401` for auth failures
  - `404` when a record is not found
  - `409` for conflicts like duplicate email
