# Express Routing

- Use `express.Router()` per file and `module.exports = router`.
- Define handlers as `async (req, res, next)` and `catch` with `next(error)`.
- Use the `validateUUID('id')` middleware for `/:id` params.
- Follow REST verbs (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) with clear route comments.
- For PATCH endpoints, reuse PUT logic by setting `req.method = 'PUT'` and `router.handle(...)`.
