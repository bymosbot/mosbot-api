# Security & Secrets — API

## Purpose

Prevent credentials from entering the repository and enforce secure defaults in the API.

## Do

- Load all configuration via `process.env` — initialize `dotenv` at the top of `src/index.js`.
- Commit `.env.example` with **placeholder values only** (e.g. `JWT_SECRET=change-me`).
- Fail fast on startup if required secrets are missing — never fall back to a default secret.
- Hash passwords with `bcrypt` (`saltRounds = 10`) before storing; use `bcrypt.compare` for login.
- Pass JWT secret exclusively from `process.env.JWT_SECRET` — no hardcoded fallback.
- Validate and normalize all file paths before forwarding to external services (block `..` sequences).

## Don't

- Don't hardcode credentials, tokens, connection strings, or internal URLs anywhere in source.
- Don't commit `.env`, `.env.local`, or any file containing real values.
- Don't log passwords, tokens, or PII at any log level.
- Don't return stack traces or internal error details in API responses — log server-side only.
- Don't set `CORS_ORIGIN=*` when credentials are enabled — use the exact dashboard origin.

## Required env vars (never have defaults)

| Variable | Why it must not have a fallback |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| `JWT_SECRET` | A weak/default secret makes all tokens forgeable |
| `DATABASE_URL` | A wrong DB silently corrupts or exposes data |

## .env files

| File | Committed? | Purpose |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- |
| `.env.example` | ✅ Yes | Placeholder template for contributors |
| `.env` | ❌ No | Local secrets (git-ignored) |

## If you accidentally committed a secret

1. **Immediately revoke / rotate** the exposed credential — assume it is compromised.
2. Remove the secret from history: use `git filter-repo` or BFG Repo Cleaner.
3. Force-push the cleaned branch and notify maintainers.
4. Verify removal: `git log -p | grep <partial-secret>`.
5. If the repo is public, treat the credential as fully compromised regardless of removal speed.

## Dependency security

- Run `npm audit` before opening a PR that adds or upgrades dependencies.
- Do not add dependencies with known high/critical CVEs without a documented justification.
